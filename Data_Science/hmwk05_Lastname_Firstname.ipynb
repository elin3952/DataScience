    "The [Gumbel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gumbel_distribution) distribution is one of several distributions frequently used to model environmental extremes (for example, extreme temperatures and sea levels).  It is also fairly asymmetric, and thus interesting for investigating confidence intervals.  It is implemented in scipy.stats as [gumbel_r](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.gumbel_r.html), where the appendix \"\\_r\" denotes the right-skewed version of the Gumbel distribution (as opposed to the left-skewed)."
